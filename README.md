# PetSitters
Our project is called PetS and it is a software program, a mobile app intended to be used both in Android and iOS system.

It is focused on two users: the person who has the pet and wants to search for someone that takes care of it and the person who is searching this kind of job.

The objective from the point of view of the pet owner are the possibility of being able to travel making sure that your pets are okay and that the tasks to do by the sitter are done. From a job seeker's perspective, this software helps you find a new job, even if you have no experience.
